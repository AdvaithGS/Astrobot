Uranus was originally named 'George';The planet Uranus was discovered by William Herschel and he chose to name it after the king of england at that time - King George. [It was later renamed to Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#Name) after Greek god of the sky in 1850.;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/William_Herschel01.jpg/255px-William_Herschel01.jpg;William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus in 1781.
Uranus' moons are named after characters in Shakespear's plays;To give due respect to British contributions to science (and also because they chose to rename 'George' to Uranus) , scientists named Uranus' moons after characters in William Shakespear's plays  - Miranda, Titania, Oberon, Ariel, Umbriel, Cordelia, Bianca  [the list is pretty long.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#Moons) ;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Uranian_moon_montage.jpg/330px-Uranian_moon_montage.jpg;Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and albedos.
The constellations in the Southern Hemisphere were identified during the industrial revolution; The constellations in the Northern Hemisphere were identified by ancient greeks and babylonians and were inspired by mythological characters - Orion,  Aries, Taurus, Cancer, etc. while the european explorers who had come to the southern hemisphere were inspired by instruments used during the industrial revolution- Telescopium, Microscopium, Horologium (The Clock), Antlia (Air Pump), Pyxis (The Compass)[ and many more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#Origin_of_the_southern_constellations);https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/South_Hemisphere.png/390px-South_Hemisphere.png;A star chart of the entire Southern Sky, centered on the south celestial pole.

Going at the speed of light;When you go at the speed of light, everything in front of you appears blue and everything behind you appears red due to the [doppler effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect), but there is also another peculiar phenomenon - known as [length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction) wherein everything in front of you expands and everything appears stretched while for an outside observer, you yourself appear stretched (and rotated a bit). So, the closer you get to the speed of light, space gets more and more stretched out for you such that it appears that everything is infintely stretched out and you seem to be going at infinte speed.
Elements named after planets;Radioactive elements numbered 92,93,94 are named Uranium(Uranium) , Neptunium(Neptune), Plutonium(Pluto) which were planets at that time - pluto is no more a planet.
How the Greeks and Romans were honoured by western scientists;After the planets were named after Roman gods, in order to make the Greek gods not feel left out (:D), they named the moons of the planets after Greek characters associated to the Greek counterparts of the  Roman gods after whom a planet is named. So Mars - god of war or Ares in Greek Mythology. So Mars' moons were named Phobos and Deimos - both Ares' attendants. All moons (except moons of Uranus) were named this way.;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Moons_of_solar_system_v7.jpg/1280px-Moons_of_solar_system_v7.jpg;Planets (and pluto) and their major moons.
Gallilean Moons;The Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in December 1609 or January 1610, and recognized by him as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610. They were the first objects found to orbit a planet other than the Earth. Galileo initially named his discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius. Marius discovered the moons independently at nearly the same time as Galileo, 8 January 1610, and gave them their present names, derived from the lovers of Zeus, which were suggested by Johannes Kepler https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Jupiter_and_the_Galilean_Satellites.jpg/800px-Jupiter_and_the_Galilean_Satellites.jpg;Montage of Jupiter's four Galilean moons, in a composite image depicting part of Jupiter and their relative sizes (positions are illustrative, not actual).

Vulcan - the decades-long hoax;Before Eistein's equations rewrote Newton's laws of gravitation, scientists had already begun seeing places where Newton's laws did not match observations.One such example was the orbit of mercury, it had an unexplained wobble that scientists then could only attribute to an unknown planet between mercury and the sun - that they hoped to someday discover - and that is how [Vulcan](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/151104-newton-einstein-gravity-vulcan-planets-mercury-astronomy-theory-of-relativity-ngbooktalk) became an official planet from 1859 till 1878;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Planet-Vulcan_1846_003790.jpg/330px-Planet-Vulcan_1846_003790.jpg;Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(hypothetical_planet)
Necroplanetology- its not just a cool word. its a science.;In 2015, astronomers discovered a star (WD 1145+017) that was shredding and devouring planets in orbit around it, in a process known as [tidal disruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event). The examaple of the star is being used a a model for understanding and reconstructing disrupted planets, to understand how they were and how they died. A planet may "die" because of several reasons, but the results of it - the scattered gas, dust and deris can be used to get hints about the original planet.;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Artist%27s_impression_of_a_white_dwarf_devouring_a_minor_planet.jpg/500px-Artist%27s_impression_of_a_white_dwarf_devouring_a_minor_planet.jpg;Artist concept of a rocky planetary object being vaporized by its parent star.
