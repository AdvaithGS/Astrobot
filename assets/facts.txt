Uranus was originally named 'George';The planet Uranus was discovered by William Herschel and he chose to name it after the king of england at that time - King George. It was later renamed to Uranus after Greek god of the sky in 1850 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#Name.;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/William_Herschel01.jpg/255px-William_Herschel01.jpg;William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus in 1781.
Uranus' moons are named after characters in Shakespear's plays;To give due respect to British contributions to science (and also because they chose to rename 'George' to Uranus) , scientists named Uranus' moons after characters in William Shakespear's plays  - Miranda, Titania, Oberon, Ariel, Umbriel, Cordelia, Bianca the list is pretty long. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#Moons.;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Uranian_moon_montage.jpg/330px-Uranian_moon_montage.jpg;Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and albedos.
The constellations in the Southern Hemisphere were identified during the industrial revolution; The constellations in the Northern Hemisphere were identified by ancient greeks and babylonians and were inspired by mythological characters - Orion,  Aries, Taurus, Cancer, etc. while the european explorers who had come to the southern hemisphere were inspired by instruments used during the industrial revolution- Telescopium, Microscopium, Horologium (The Clock), Antlia (Air Pump), Pyxis (The Compass) and many more. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#Origin_of_the_southern_constellations;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/South_Hemisphere.png/390px-South_Hemisphere.png;A star chart of the entire Southern Sky, centered on the south celestial pole.

The Earth is the brightest radio object for some frequencies;Due to massive technological developments in the last centuries, the Earth is the brightest radio emmiter in certain frequencies - it is even brighter than the Sun and Jupiter. 
Going at the speed of light;When you go at the speed of light, everything in front of you appears blue and everything behind you appears red due to the doppler effect - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect, but there is also another peculiar effect - knwon as length contraction wherein everything in front of you expands and everything appears stretched while for an outside observer, you yourself appear stretched (and rotated a bit) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction. So, the closer you get to the speed of light, space gets more and more stretched out for you such that it appears that everything is infintely stretched out and you seem to be going at infinte speed.
Elements named after planets;Radioactive elements numbered 92,93,94 are named Uranium(Uranium) , Neptunium(Neptune), Plutonium(Pluto) which were planets at that time - pluto is no more a planet.
How the Greeks and Romans were honoured by western scientists;After the planets were named after Roman gods, in order to make the Greek gods not feel left out (:D), they named the moons of the planets after Greek characters associated to the Greek counterparts of the  Roman gods after whom a planet is named. So Mars - god of war or Ares in Greek Mythology. So Mars' moons were named Phobos and Deimos - both Ares' attendants. All moons (except moons of Uranus) were named this way.;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Moons_of_solar_system_v7.jpg/1280px-Moons_of_solar_system_v7.jpg;Planets (and pluto) and their major moons.
